## To-do-list ##

> The project's goal is to learn how to use webpack. "To-do list" is a tool that helps to organize your day. It simply lists the things that you need to do and allows you to mark them as complete. You will build a simple website that allows for doing that, and you will do it using ES6 and Webpack!
